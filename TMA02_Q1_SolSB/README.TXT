PROJECT TITLE: TMA02_Q1_SolSB

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 
This project fulfils the requirements of TMA02 Question 1.
The RockPaperScissors class in this project is used to play a game of 
Rock, Paper, Scissors with the computer. 
The user can input either ‘rock’, ‘paper’ or ‘scissors’ into the 
terminal and the computer will choose an option, using the random 
class. 
Then both options will be confirmed, and the winner of the round be 
determined as well as the number of rounds each player has won. 
The winner of the game is the first to win three rounds.

DATE: 01/02/2022

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:

Create an instance of the RockPaperScissors class in BlueJ and 
select the playGame() method on the object in the object bench. 
Then follow the prompts in the terminal. 

AUTHORS: Steven Baker

USER INSTRUCTIONS:

If the user does not enter either ‘rock’ ‘paper’ or ‘scissors’ 
into the terminal when prompted, the computer will win the round. 
If both the user and the computer have chosen the same option, 
then the round is a draw and the score will not be incremented 
for either player.
