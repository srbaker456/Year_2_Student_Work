PROJECT TITLE: TMA02_Q2_SolSB

PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
This project fulfils the requirements of TMA02 Question 2 
The Thesaurus class within can be used to look up
the alternative words of a given word, also known as a synonym. 
New synonyms can be added to the thesaurus, and it can replace 
selected words for their synonyms in a given sentence. 
Synonyms can also be cross-referenced so that a given word's synonyms 
can also be looked up in the thesaurus.

DATE: 05/02/2022

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
Create a new object of the Thesaurus class. The object will hold no
values at the start, so use the populate method to add three words 
and their synonyms to the thesaurus.

AUTHORS: Steven Baker

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
The print method can then be used to show the thesaurus. 
The addSynonym method can be used to 
add words and their synonyms, and there is a cross-reference method
so that synonyms can be presented as key words in the thesaurus.
There is also the replaceWord method so that a word in the thesaurus
that is used in a given sentence , can be replaced by its synonyms.
